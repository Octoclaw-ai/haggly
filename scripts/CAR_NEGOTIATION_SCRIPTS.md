# Car Negotiation Scripts for Haggly App

## BUYER SIDE: "I'm Buying a Car"

### Scenario Selection
**Private Seller vs Dealership**
- Private: More personal, emotional approach
- Dealership: Professional, process-focused approach

### Private Seller - Question Sequence

#### Phase 1: Rapport Building
```
Script Options:
1. "This is exactly what I've been looking for! You've clearly taken great care of it."
2. "I can tell this car means something to you. What made you decide to sell?"
3. "Beautiful [car model]! I've always wanted one of these."

Haggly Tip: Mirror their energy. If they're enthusiastic, match it. If they're reserved, be respectful.
```

#### Phase 2: Information Gathering (Strategic Questioning)
```
Maintenance Track:
□ "Do you have maintenance records I could look at?"
□ "When was the last oil change/major service?"
□ "Any upcoming maintenance due? (timing belt, brakes, etc.)"
□ "Have you been the only owner?"

Haggly Insight: Each "no" or hesitation creates negotiating leverage.

Condition Track:
□ "Has it ever been in any accidents?"
□ "Do you have the Carfax report?"
□ "Any paint work or bodywork done?"
□ "How are the tires? When were they last replaced?"

Usage Track:
□ "Mostly highway miles or city driving?"
□ "Ever used for long road trips?"
□ "Any pets or smoking in the car?"
```

#### Phase 3: Creating Negotiating Position
```
After gathering info, pause and say:
"I really do love the car, and I can see you've [acknowledge something positive they said]. 

However, I'm a bit concerned about [mention 2-3 items from your questions - maintenance due, no records, accident, etc.]. 

Given these factors, I was thinking more in the range of $[X]. Would that work for you?"

Haggly Note: Always acknowledge something positive first, then present concerns as "we" problems to solve together.
```

### Dealership - Professional Approach

#### Before You Go
```
Haggly Checklist:
□ Get pre-approved financing from your bank/credit union
□ Research fair market value (use KBB, Edmunds, local listings)
□ Set your walk-away price
□ Bring pre-approval letter

Key Phrase: "I'm pre-approved elsewhere, but open to your financing if the terms are better."
```

#### At the Dealership
```
Opening Line: "I'm interested in this specific vehicle. What's your best price?"

Avoid These Traps:
❌ "What's the monthly payment?" (focuses on wrong metric)
❌ "I need to keep payments under $X" (gives them target to hit with longer terms)
❌ "I'm trading in this car" (handle separately)

Instead Say:
✅ "What's the total out-the-door price?"
✅ "I'll handle financing separately"
✅ "Let's focus on the car price first"
```

#### Handling Common Dealer Responses
```
When they say: "Let me check with my manager"
You say: "I understand. While you do that, I'll step outside and think it over / look at other options."

When they say: "This price is only good today"
You say: "I appreciate the urgency, but I never make major purchases under pressure. If this is the right deal, I'm sure we can work something out."

When they say: "What would it take to earn your business today?"
You say: "$[your target price] out the door, and I can make a decision."
```

## SELLER SIDE: "I'm Selling a Car"

### Pre-Sale Setup
```
Haggly Preparation Checklist:
□ Gather all maintenance records
□ Clean car inside and out
□ Take high-quality photos
□ Research comparable listings
□ Set firm minimum price (your walk-away point)

Psychological Positioning:
"I have maintenance records" = shows care and reduces buyer concerns
"Several people are interested" = creates scarcity (if true)
```

### Handling Buyer Questions

#### Maintenance Questions
```
When they ask: "Do you have maintenance records?"
Best Response: "Absolutely! Here's everything - oil changes, inspections, any repairs. I believe in taking care of my investments."

When they ask: "Any upcoming maintenance?"
Best Response: "I just had it serviced last month, so it's ready to go. Here's the recent service report."
```

#### Condition Questions
```
When they ask: "Any accidents?"
If YES: "There was a minor incident [be specific - rear-ended, parking lot, etc.]. It was professionally repaired at [shop name] with OEM parts. Here's the paperwork."

If NO: "Never. I'm a careful driver and this car has been garage-kept."

Haggly Tip: Honesty builds trust. Lies kill deals and can create legal issues.
```

#### Negotiation Responses
```
When they lowball (offer 60% of asking):
"I appreciate your interest. I've done my research on comparable cars, and my price reflects the condition and care this car has received. I'm open to reasonable offers from serious buyers."

When they point out flaws:
"I understand your concerns about [their issue]. That's already factored into my pricing. Compared to similar cars on the market, this is still a great value because [highlight 2-3 positives]."

When they ask "What's your bottom line?":
"My asking price is fair based on the market. If you're serious about the car, make me an offer and we can discuss it."
```

### Counter-Offer Strategies
```
Instead of: "I can't do that"
Try: "I can't do $X, but I could consider $Y if you can [pick it up this week / pay cash / etc.]"

Instead of: "That's too low"
Try: "That's below what I need to get. I'm at $X because [give 1-2 specific reasons]."

The Pause: After they make an offer, pause for 3-5 seconds before responding. This shows you're considering it seriously.
```

## Advanced NLP Techniques

### Mirroring (Subtle)
- If they speak slowly, slow down your pace
- If they're detail-oriented, provide details
- If they're casual, be conversational
- If they're business-like, be professional

### Reframing Language
**Instead of:** "It's expensive but..."
**Say:** "It's an investment in reliable transportation"

**Instead of:** "It's old but..."
**Say:** "It's classic and proven reliable"

### Presupposition Techniques
**Instead of:** "Would you consider $X?"
**Say:** "When we settle on $X, how quickly could you pick it up?"

This assumes agreement and moves to logistics, making the price feel more acceptable.
