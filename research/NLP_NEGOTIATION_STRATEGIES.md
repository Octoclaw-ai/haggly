# NLP Negotiation Strategies for Haggly

## Core NLP Principles for Negotiation

### 1. Rapport Building
**Mirror and Match:**
- Body language mirroring (subtle, not obvious)
- Speaking pace and tone matching
- Using their language patterns ("investment" vs "cost")

**For Sellers:** "I understand you're looking for the best value..."
**For Buyers:** "I can see this means a lot to you..."

### 2. Anchoring
**High Anchor (Sellers):** Start negotiations higher than desired price
**Low Anchor (Buyers):** Open with lower offer to shift reference point

### 3. Reframing
**Sellers:** "This isn't an expense, it's an investment"
**Buyers:** "This isn't about the money, it's about finding the right fit"

### 4. Presuppositions
**Instead of:** "Will you take $X?"
**Use:** "When we settle on $X, what's the timeline?"

## Car Negotiation Scripts

### PRIVATE SELLER - Buyer's Playbook

#### Opening Rapport Phase
- "Beautiful car! You've clearly taken good care of it"
- "I can tell this has been well-maintained"
- *Mirror their energy level and speaking style*

#### Information Gathering (Wearing Down Phase)
**Maintenance Questions:**
- "Do you have maintenance records?"
- "When was the last major service?"
- "Any upcoming maintenance due?"
- "Original owner or did you buy it used?"

**Condition Questions:**
- "Any accidents or insurance claims?"
- "Carfax available?"
- "Any paint work or body repair?"
- "How are the tires/brakes?"

**Usage Questions:**
- "Mostly highway or city driving?"
- "Any smoking in the car?"
- "Ever used for rideshare/delivery?"

#### The Psychological Effect
Each question plants seeds of doubt about "perfect condition"
Creates mental list of potential issues/costs for buyer

#### Negotiation Phase
**After information gathering:**
"I really like the car, but considering [mention 2-3 concerns from above], I'm thinking more in the $X range. Does that work for you?"

### DEALERSHIP - Buyer's Playbook

#### Pre-Visit Preparation
- Research true market value (KBB, Edmunds, local comps)
- Get pre-approved financing elsewhere
- Know walk-away price

#### At the Dealership
**Opening:** "I'm interested in this specific car. What's your best price?"
**Never say:** "What's your monthly payment?" (focuses on wrong metric)

#### Handling Common Dealer Tactics
**"Let me check with my manager"**
- Response: "I understand. While you do that, I'll look at some other options"

**"This price is only good today"**
- Response: "I appreciate that. I need to think it over. If it's meant to be, maybe there will be another opportunity"

### SELLER'S PLAYBOOK

#### Pre-Sale Positioning
**Create scarcity:** "I have two other people coming to look at it this weekend"
**Establish value:** Have documentation ready (maintenance records, receipts)

#### Handling Buyer Questions
**Maintenance concerns:** "Here are all the records. As you can see, I've stayed on top of everything"
**Accident history:** Be honest but reframe: "Minor fender bender, all professionally repaired with quality parts"

#### Negotiation Responses
**To lowball offers:** "I appreciate the offer. Based on my research and the car's condition, I'm confident in my asking price. However, I'm open to reasonable offers from serious buyers"

**Counter-offer technique:** "I can't do $X, but I could consider $Y if you can pick it up this week"

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Create decision trees** for different responses
2. **Add timing guidance** (when to pause, when to speak)
3. **Include body language tips**
4. **Add exit strategies** for both sides
